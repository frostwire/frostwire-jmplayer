[00:35.624]I never thought I'd see the day
[00:38.426]I thought that I had finally moved along
[00:43.808]And I had let you go so long ago, so long
[00:49.269]This is not, this is not where I belong
[00:57.384]So I wait for this shallow itch to pass
[01:05.981]And I wait, yeah I wait
[01:12.142]Hey hey, I'm ok
[01:15.183]I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
[01:19.825]What's yours and mine
[01:23.646]Oh oh, I don't know
[01:26.448]What I was ever hoping I would find
[01:31.667]But it's time for me to leave this all behind
[01:35.744]
[01:46.209]I don't regret a single thing
[01:48.988]I couldn't say it didn't feel alright
[01:54.104]But I don't want to stay and I don't want to fight
[01:59.762]All alone, with my foolish appetite
[02:07.943]So I wait for this shallow itch to pass
[02:16.521]And I wait, yeah I wait
[02:22.725]Hey hey, I'm ok
[02:25.686]I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
[02:30.384]What's yours and mine
[02:34.127]Oh oh, I don't know
[02:36.988]What I was ever hoping I would find
[02:42.289]But it's time for me to leave this all behind
[02:45.366]I don't have the heart to give away to you again
[02:51.087]I don't have the stomach for it, no one ever wins
[02:56.708]We had our fun but I have sung this song to you before
[03:01.689]Here's my last refrain
[03:08.059]Hey hey, I'm ok
[03:10.814]I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
[03:15.500]What's yours and mine
[03:19.311]Oh oh, I don't know
[03:22.112]What I was ever hoping I would find
[03:27.343]But it's time for me to leave this all behind
[03:30.815]Hey hey, I'm ok
[03:32.986]I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
[03:38.027]What's yours and mine
[03:41.918]Oh oh, I don't know
[03:44.549]What I was ever hoping I would find
[03:50.044]But it's time for me to leave this all behind
[03:54.824]
