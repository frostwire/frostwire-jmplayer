Servers:

Main Server:
------------
Our Main server is hosted at telepoint.bg
for more details see: https://www.ffmpeg.org/#thanks_sponsor_0001
Nothing runs on our main server directly, instead several VMs run on it.

Main server security:
---------------------
Telepoint is one of the largest Bulgarian DC providers with multiple sibling companies offering
Internet, SDH, DWDM, peering exchange and hosting. They have multiple DC buildings in Sofia and
FFmpeg is hosted in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The building is locked down and accessible
only with personal key cards that are registered. People who are granted access to a rack have
to go through the access center with their ID to get logged and receive a one-time access card
that can open the service elevator and only the hall where the destination rack is. All racks are
locked, once access is granted to someone they will get a key for the rack for the duration of
their visit. There are security cameras everywhere and personnel in the access center 24/7. As for
software security, our BIOS and IPMI are protected by password and encrypted connection, and
the machines can be accessed only by root administrators with their SSH keys. They're using
a Ubuntu LTS release and get regular security updates as they are released. We also get
notified by email for various security related events (e.g. failed sudo).

Side note - Telepoint provides the rack and physical infrastructure, their sibling company called
            Telehouse which is an ISP provides the connectivity, they are directly connected with
            over 15 tier-1 service providers and have over 100 PoPs (points of presence)
            in various cities. You can see more on www.telehouse.bg
